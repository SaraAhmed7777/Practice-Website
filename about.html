      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        CUNYServe is a platform created by students to inspire action, service, and leadership across the CUNY system. It was built with a simple mission: make it easier for students to engage in meaningful civic and volunteer work that benefits New York City's communities.

    <!-- Why Civic Engagement? -->
    <div>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#00539B] mb-4">Why Civic Engagement?</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        Civic engagement is more than just volunteering — it's about being an active participant in shaping a better society. Whether you’re helping your neighborhood, supporting a cause you care about, or learning how institutions work, civic action builds stronger communities and deeper understanding. CUNYServe helps students become change-makers, one opportunity at a time.
